->FOLLOW THE GIVEN STEPS TO SUCCESSFULLY CLONE A REACT APP FROM GITHUB REPOSITORY

#1.Creating a New Folder
So, we'll create a new folder. You can name it whatever you want. I will suggest you pick a name related to the repo to be cloned, for easy detection. But the name ultimately depends on your choice.

#2.Getting the Code URL
To clone the said React app GitHub repo, you have to possess the specific URL to open the GitHub repo on your browser.

#3.Cloning the React app's GitHub Repo
Now, open the git bash window for the new folder you just created by right clicking on the folder and clicking Git bash here.

#4.On your git bash window, type git clone, paste the code URL of the GitHub repo, then run the command by pressing enter.
git clone ‘the code URL of the github repo’
At the end of the process, if you did everything correct, you won't encounter any errors meaning the cloning process was completed successfully.

#5.Once you’ve completed the previous step, to create package-lock.json file and node_modules folder,open your terminal and change your directory to the name of the cloned folder.

#6.Once that is done successfully, you need to run 'npm install' . This will take some time to finish running.

#7.After successful completion of the above stated steps,follow the command below or simply run 'npm start' in your terminal.

Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
